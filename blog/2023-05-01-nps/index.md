# Project Description: An Programming Language By an Idiot for the Idiots

## Project Title: PigLang

## Project Description
PigLang(or Pig) is a very Simple Programming Language with Python like Syntax which can be used to learn the basics and a bit Advanced Programming Concepts. Pig offers all the basic functions and implementation found in Other Programming Languages. Pig is Fast and a Fun to work with Language.

### Pig's Keywords Are very Simple and Innovative such as:- 
1. Variables are defined with var
    ```js
     let a = 1 
2. Functions are also very simple and they are defined with the keyword do
    ```js
     fn add(a,b) a + b 
3. Conditional Statements such as `if` `else` are also innovative as 
```js 
if (x == 0) {0} else { if (x == 1){return 1;}}
```
4. Easy to Make Arrays and Hashmaps
```js 
let people = [{"name": "Anna", "age": 24}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 99}];
```

## Key Features
1. Very Simple

2. Fast

3. Compiled

## Why I Chose This Project
I chose to develop this new Programming Language, I want more people to discover this Innovative and Advanced World of Programming, Many people think Programming is tough thus they never learn it, So i wanted to Change that by creating a simple new Language

Furthermore, the project provides an opportunity to showcase my skills and creativity as a Programmer. It challenges me to think outside the box and find innovative ways to simplify Programming. The development process will involve honing my programming skills, Logical Thinking, and Patience as It will take a lot of time.
