## NEVER GONNA GIVE UP NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
I got Distracted by School Work And Exams and will continue be distracted because of Mid-term Examination, But i Will Continue to Work on the Pig, OINK !
## I COMPLETED THE VM
I Dont know how it works and why it works but it works, i think it works because of the ```match``` Statements and ```assert_eq!``` macro
### WILL CONTINUE DEVLOGS AFTER THE EXAMS
