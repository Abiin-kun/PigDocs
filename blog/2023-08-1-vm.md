### " Magicians protect their secrets not because the secrets are large and important, but because they are so small and trivial. The wonderful effects created on stage are often the result of a secret so absurd that the magician would be embarrassed to admit that that was how it was done. "
#### -Christopher Priest, The Prestige


The idea of representing a program as a series of bytecode instructions has been discussed extensively, but it is like to studying biology using only plush, lifeless creatures. Though we've never actually seen instructions in action, we know what they do in theory, so it's difficult to fully comprehend what they accomplish. Without a solid grasp of the behavior of the bytecode, it would be difficult to create a compiler that produces bytecode.
## Virtual Machine
Virtual Machine is an Machine which uses bytecode on top of the Bare Metal. Think of it as an Portable Machine we can carry and run anywhere.
